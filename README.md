Ultrasonic CW Doppler RADAR for sports object velocity estimation and research purposes. A low-budget well-packaged portable RADAR is detailed in this repository from hardware to signal processing. This is a final year project contributing towards my degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Cape Town, supervised by Dr Yunus Abdul Gaffar.

The application can load existing recorded RADAR data - this data can be found at the following Google Drive link:

For details on what experiments were carried out and thus what data was collected, read the final report in the repository.
